# Matrix_v0
This repo has the first version of our game engine based, and LLM character based city realistic simulator. Through continous devleopment we aim at making this a large scale simulator with hundreds of autonmous human like agents to test specific scenarios and setups. Or the more sophisticated vision of studying learning and evolution when LLM, RAG, and advanced reasoning are the supporting methods for each human lilke agent. 

Being the only first step we test our version with online LLM APIs,  and we simulate a specific scenario discussed in the our paper [reference].
